Abstract

In our daily lives, we frequently encounter decisions where the potential outcomes are unclear, leading to a state of heightened uncertainty. The complete or partial lack of knowledge regarding the probability of outcomes is called ambiguity and presents significant challenges for individuals. While recent studies have associated the level of ambiguity in decision-making with neural activity in the parietal cortex, the precise role of this brain region and its interactions with other brain regions during decision-making processes are not well known. Here, we present a comprehensive dataset detailing human decision-making under conditions of risk and ambiguity. This dataset includes data from 53 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 31 years, consisting of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI: T1w, T2w, and DWI) and functional MRI (fMRI) acquired during task performance, as well as concurrent electrophysiological (EEG) recordings during inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over two parietal regions and the vertex. This dataset offers an opportunity to delve into the neurobiological mechanisms of decision-making in detail, highlighting the role of the parietal cortex.
